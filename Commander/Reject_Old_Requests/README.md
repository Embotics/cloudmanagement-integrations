# Commander - Cleanup requests Running for X number of days

Script that rejects requests that have been running for a set amount of time(days). It's imperitive that when implementing this the duration takes into account Requests that may run the duration of weekend or holiday. 

Requirements:
* Recommended to use a Snow Commander Superuser account.
* Module designed to be run with a schedualed Command workflow. 
* Commander 8.10.X or Higher 

Note: this can be modified to cleanup requests in specific states such as "WAITING" if there was a need to auto reject requests not approved in X amount of time.
